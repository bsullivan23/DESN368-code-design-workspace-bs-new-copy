<h1>New vs. Old, This Time With a River</h1>
<h3>March 23, 2005</h3>
<p>That seems to be the main divide between old and new -- <br>not on change versus stasis, but on how change comes about, whether to get ahead of it, develop a vision for the waterfront, enhance a new tourism-based economy or let the market decide much as it has in the past.</p>
<p>In that sense, Cold Spring's story is one of many towns along the Hudson, once forgotten, now courted, once left for dead, now facing a menace that was unthinkable two decades ago -- sky-high real estate prices, runaway development, the downside of being places where dead foundries get a post-industrial life and there's no such thing as a Hudson River Brigadoon.</p>
