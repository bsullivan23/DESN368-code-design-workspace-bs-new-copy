          <h5>Design Decisions:</h5>
          <h6>What design choices did you make and why?</h6>
          <p>The design that I went for was soft and minimal. I drew each icon digitally and focused on a cohesive color palette that was not too distracting from the content of the guide. I struggled coming up with what subject to do the guide on and I found that what I needed most was something that would make me less anxious. I thought that the pink, yellow, green and blue colors throughout were very complimentary to the ideas throughout the guide. I chose brown for the buttons and section headings, and text because it seemed like a good neutral.  </p>
          <p> Overall my goal with the design for this website was to make something that felt approachable and calming. I didn't want it to feel overwhelming to the readers. I think that I was able to execute this vision fairly well. My favorite part of the design is the digital drawing aspects that I incorporated. </p>
          <h5>Technical Challenges:</h5>
          <h6>What was difficult to code? How did solve it?</h6>
          <p>The part that I struggled most to code was the flexbox aspects. It was an entirely new realm of code that I had not really put into a design before, besides tutorials. It was quite overwhelming and I still don't feel like I completely understand it. For me the sidebar was tricky because I wanted the second flower image and the back to top button to stay stuck to the bottom and that was something that I had never attempted prior.</p>
          <p> I mentioned this in my comments throughout my css but I did need ai to help me navigate these problems that I was facing. I was able to learn much from the coding experience and I am very glad that I was able to fix those hiccups with copilot. I hope that with the next project I will only be able to be faster when navigating difficult aspects of coding and understand even more.</p>
          <h5>Responsive Strategy:</h5>
          <h6>How did you adapt your design for mobile?</h6>
          <p> When I approached restructuring my design for mobile I knew that most everything was going to have to be stacked vertically. I know that on the desktop there is alot of widespacing and spacing for decorative elements as well as a large sidebar. I didn't want anything to feel crammed so I kept alot of breathing room. The biggest shift was definetly the side bar moving to a hamburger at the top. I decided to remove the desorative flowers visible on my sidebar on desktop to not appear on my mobile version. The yellow flowers felt unnessecary especially when there is only so much space available on a phone and everything is competeing for your attention. </p>
            <p>Throughout the entire process my main goal was to make sure that everything remained readable, centered, and easy to navigate on a phone. I wanted the mobile experience to feel intentional and well thought out. The reorganization took a bit of thought but I think that it turned out well.   </p>
          <h5>Learning Moments:</h5>
          <h6>What did you learn about Flexbox or CSS positioning?</h6>   
          <p> During this project I learned pretty much everything about flexbox and I am still attempting to fully ccomprehend it. This project made it so that I had to put what I had learned from the tutorials into a real layout. I realized relatively quickly that Flexbox is not just about  turning something into a row or column. The small properties like align-items, leftover padding, or even the order of the elements can completely change how everything lines up. I really struggled with the sidebar and mobile navigation, but with a bit of help from ai and other rescources I was able to troubleshoot. It was alot of trial and error but I am happy to have more understanding now than I did before. </p> 
          <p>I learned that Flexbox can be incedibly helpful, but only when the stucture is clean and organized. If something is incorrect in the HTML or container, Flexbox will follow that leading to everything looking incorrect. Centering elements, controlling spacing and preventing things from drifting on mobile taught me that I really need to slow down and test one thing at a time. </p>
          <h5>Future Improvements:</h5>
          <h6>What would you add or change with more time?</h6> 
          <p> If I had more time on this project, I would focus mainly on refining the small details that would make the layout feel polished and consistent across every screen size. There are a few areas on the mobile version where spacing and alignment could be smoother, especially around the textboxes and decorative elements. I'd also like to go back to my image png and svgs and crop them more flush to the design. THis would help me not have to use as much CSS positioning to adjust.</p> 
          <p>I know that this project wasn't focused on animations but I would like to play with those more on this project if I had more time. Even just the simple ease transition on my section titles and back to top button made all of the difference in the immersion on my page. I think this would add a whole new level and let me explore what is possible with my designs when coded. </p>
